# Design-Patterns
Simple examples from my Object Oriented Development course illustrating the use of design patterns. Currently there are about 26 design patterns. Here are a few I am currently implementing.

# The patterns are classified into 3 types: Behavioral, Creational, and Structural

# Behavioral - These patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.
Command, Iterator, Observer, State, and Strategy

# Creational - These design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation. These patterns can be further categorized into Class-creational patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

Factory Method, Abstract Factory, and Singleton

# Structural - These design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality.

Adapter, Composite, and Decorator
